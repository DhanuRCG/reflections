**How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It contains + sign for newly inserted lines and - sign for deleted lines

**How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Then it is easy to correct the newly created errors asap.

**What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Then we can make sure that neither commits are too big or too small
    Cons: Manually committing can be hard for a bigger project,as you may in a hurry to
	  finish it rather committing every time. 

**Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because some changes done affect multiple files at the same time

**How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log command help us to see all the commits and using git diff we can check
	the difference between each commits

**How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can always go back to the working state without much trouble using git 
    checkout command

**Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   To version-control of my upcoming projectss
