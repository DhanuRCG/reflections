01) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When we want to share and our project and we can get others to develop our project also. 
  It is a good way to work as a team.

02) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I don't need always to update my local branch whenever a change occured in remote
branch. I can decide and pull manually rather doing it automatically.
