01)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It create hidden .git directory in the folder which we are in. If 
we want to version control our project we have to make it a repository which 
keep track of our changes.

02)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	staging area is a logical intermediate level where the files which we want
to commit is in. Repository contains untracked files and added files to be committed.
